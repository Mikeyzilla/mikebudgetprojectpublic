Known Issues: 

A) Separate CSS concerns - Angular supports multi-css files impacting a single HTML file.

B) Right now we only did the ideal based on salary - however we need to add in state and dependents as factors as well.

C) Test login, submit budget, export budget, and logout to make sure it works in reality (use the server alongside the frontend).

D) Then re enable security by deleting that security config file.

E) Add in view budget and export to pdf implementation later on.
