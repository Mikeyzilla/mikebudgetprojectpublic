Known Issues: 

A) Then create About Us.

B) Then work on Login Page. Connect Login to backend using UserService.

C) Then create the Budget Form. Use a repeatable budget object inside of the budget form feature. Connect budget form to backend using appropriate services. 

D) Have the budget form display a budget chart that can be exported to pdf. Chart is created using Chart.js.

E) Towards the end of the project, add a readme and separate CSS concerns - Angular supports multi-css files impacting a single HTML file. Also re enable security by deleting that security config file.
