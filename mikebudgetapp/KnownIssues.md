Known Issues: 

A) Style export budget. 

B) Separate CSS concerns - Angular supports multi-css files impacting a single HTML file.

C) Since we can track logged in status using user session service, inject it into the nav bar, and hide sign up & log in buttons if the user is already logged in. 

D) See if there's a way to, where if the user is not logged in and both buttons are visible, change the CSS of the Nav Bar Slogan.

E) Test login, submit budget, and export budget to make sure it works in reality (use the server alongside the frontend).

F) Then re enable security by deleting that security config file.

G) Add in view budget and export to pdf implementation later on.
