Known Issues: 

A) Work on Login Page. Connect Login to backend using UserService.

B) Add in an area to create-budget where you set the number of dependents, location, occupation, etc. Extract the Budget Component itself so that reuse is easy. Connect budget form to backend using appropriate services. 

C) Once the budget is submitted, not only add it to the list of budgets the user has, but lead the user to a page that will display a budget chart that can be exported to pdf. Chart is created using Chart.js.

D) Towards the end of the project, add a readme and separate CSS concerns - Angular supports multi-css files impacting a single HTML file. Also re enable security by deleting that security config file.
