Known Issues: 

A) Style SignUp. Remember to add in username and password checks (strength) and do error checking with submit where, if the user submits missing info, submit doesn't work.

B) Test Signup using spring boot and oracle db (Docker)

C) Then work on Login Page. Connect Login to backend using UserService.

D) Then create About Us.

E) Then create the Budget Form. Use a repeatable budget object inside of the budget form feature. Connect budget form to backend using appropriate services. 

F) Have the budget form display a budget chart that can be exported to pdf. Chart is created using Chart.js.

G) Towards the end of the project, add a readme and separate CSS concerns - Angular supports multi-css files impacting a single HTML file.
