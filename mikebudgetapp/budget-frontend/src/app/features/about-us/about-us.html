            My name is Mike! I'm trying to build my portfolio with GitHub projects that showcase my skills. In this project, I wanted to create a fake budgeting app that shows that I learned how to use Angular and Spring Boot. The way I did this was by using AI and YouTube videos to help clarify what I didn't know. The result is that, even though I used AI, I can now build Spring Boot backends with ease, and I have a basic understanding of how Angular works. I wanted to be fully transparent! Hope you enjoy.
